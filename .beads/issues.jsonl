{"id":"OrbWeaver-zxe","title":"Frontend DMs: add ability to start new conversations with friends","description":"CRITICAL UX BUG: There is currently no way to initiate a new DM conversation with a friend from the frontend UI. Users can only see existing conversations but cannot start one. Need a 'New Message' button/flow that shows your friends list and lets you select a recipient to start a conversation. This is a non-starter for the DM feature.","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"58714428+MLTQ@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-02-05T23:18:27.839084-05:00","created_by":"MLTQ","updated_at":"2026-02-07T17:50:59.650932-05:00","closed_at":"2026-02-07T17:50:59.650932-05:00","close_reason":"Added '+ New Message' button to Messages view with inline peer picker.
