{"id":"OrbWeaver-qh7","title":"Implement radial phylogenetic tree view for threads","description":"Replace or supplement the Sugiyama hierarchical view with a radial phylogenetic tree layout.\n\n## Layout Algorithm\n\n- **Ring 0 (center)**: Original post (OP)\n- **Ring N**: Posts where max(ring(parent) for all parents) = N-1\n- Posts with multiple parents are placed based on their DEEPEST parent\n- Example: A post replying to OP (ring 0) and a ring 4 post goes on ring 5\n\n## Visual Design\n\n1. **Radial rings**: Concentric circles emanating from center\n2. **Post orientation**: Each post rotated so its top edge points toward the center\n3. **Selection rotation**: When selecting a node, animate the entire view rotating to bring that node to the user's viewing angle (like spinning a round table)\n4. **Edge rendering**: Lines connecting posts to all parents (may cross rings)\n5. **Angular clustering**: Related subtrees should cluster together angularly\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n- Start fresh rather than modifying Sugiyama code\n- Handle multi-parent edges (post_relationships table)\n- Consider angular distribution algorithm to minimize edge crossings\n- Smooth animation for the table rotation effect\n- Camera/zoom controls similar to existing graph view\n\n## Files likely involved\n\n- New file: graphchan_frontend/src/app/ui/radial.rs\n- Modify: graphchan_frontend/src/app/ui/mod.rs (add view option)\n- Modify: graphchan_frontend/src/app/state.rs (view state if needed)","status":"in_progress","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"58714428+MLTQ@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-02-02T01:46:27.228945-05:00","created_by":"MLTQ","updated_at":"2026-02-02T01:50:16.248645-05:00"}
